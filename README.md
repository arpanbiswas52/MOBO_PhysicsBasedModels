# MOBO tutorials
The repository contains Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework, integrated to unconstrained multi-objective optimization of different physics based numerical models.
The MOBO framework in build under GpyTorch/BoTorch package.

**Guide to tutorials**:

Start with "SimpleGP/BO tutorial.ipynb". Here we illustrate 1D Gaussian Process and search space exploration by maximizing acquisition function (using BO).

Then check "Classical MOBO tutorial.ipynb". Here we extend from BO to MOBO, and illustrate MOBO implementation to non-physics toy problems.

Then check "PhysicsDriven MOBO (PZO) tutorial.ipynb". Here we extend to MOBO implementation to physics based complex model.

Check the latest versions of the above mentioned titles.

In future, the framework will be extended to solve constrained problems
