# Physics driven-MOBO
The repository contains MOBO framework, integrated to unconstrained or contrained multi-objective optimization of different physics based numerical models.
The MOBO framework in build under GpyTorch/BoTorch package.
Start with unconstrained version. Then check the constrained version.
Check the latest versions
