# Physics driven-MOBO
The repository contains MOBO framework, integrated to unconstrained multi-objective optimization of different physics based numerical models.
The MOBO framework in build under GpyTorch/BoTorch package.
Check the latest versions.

In future, the framework will be extended to solve constrained problems
